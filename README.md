DeskPro iOS Messenger is a Chat/AI/Messaging product. You can embed a “widget” directly into native app, so that enables end-users to use the product. Similar implementation for [Android](https://github.com/deskpro/messenger-sdk-android).

## Requirements

- iOS 14.0+
- Swift 5.7+
- Xcode 14.0+

## Running the tests

Once you're in the root directory of the package, you can run the tests using the Swift Package Manager's `swift test` command. This will compile the package and its tests, and then run the tests. This command will execute all test cases defined in the Swift Package.

## Installation

- File > Swift Packages > Add Package Dependency
- Add `https://github.com/deskpro/messenger-sdk-ios`
- Select "Up to Next Major" with "1.0.0"
